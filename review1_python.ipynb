    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm that allows you to model real-world entities as \"objects\" in your code. In Python, **classes** are the foundation of OOP, enabling developers to encapsulate data (attributes) and functionality (methods) into reusable and maintainable code structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**: Group related data and operations together to create a self-contained entity. For example, a `Student` class can store a student's scores and provide methods to calculate their average or grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reusability**: Classes allow you to define blueprints for objects. Once defined, you can create multiple instances of the class, reducing code duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modularity**: Classes promote organized code by separating functionality into logical blocks. This modularity makes the code easier to debug, maintain, and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Abstraction**: Hide implementation details and expose only necessary functionalities, making your code user-friendly and less error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Advanced concepts that allow you to create specialized classes based on existing ones and define common interfaces for different implementations.\n"
