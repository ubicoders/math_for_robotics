    "Differential equations describe the relationship between a function and its derivatives. They are widely used in physics, engineering, and other scientific fields to model dynamic systems such as motion, growth, and decay.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)\n",
    "- An ODE involves derivatives of a function with respect to a single variable (e.g., time).\n",
    "- Example: $\\frac{dy}{dt} = -g$, where $y$ is the position, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numerical Solution of ODEs\n",
    "- Differential equations can be solved analytically or numerically.\n",
    "- Numerical methods like **Euler's method** approximate solutions by iteratively updating the value of the function over small time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Problem\n",
    "- We simulate the free fall of an object under gravity using:\n",
    "  - Position: $y(t)$\n",
    "  - Velocity: $v(t) = \\frac{dy}{dt}$\n",
